# tikz-nfold â€“ higher order paths in TikZ

This library adds higher-order paths to [TikZ][pgf] and also fixes some graphical issues with TikZ' `double` paths, used e.g. in wide arrows. It is also compatible with [tikz-cd][tikz-cd], adding support for triple and higher arrows. See the [documentation](tikz-nfold-doc.pdf) for full details.

This package is available on [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/tikz-nfold). Availability on MiKTeX and TeX Live is in the works.
